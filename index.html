        <h2>Iris Vedroth</h2>
        <h3>Kris Cleland || 10/9/24</h3>
        <p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about a few of my Dungeons & Dragons characters; specifically, Iris Vedroth. Iris is an oathbreaker paladin multiclassed with the great old one warlock class, and they are particularly messed up. </p>
        <p>They used to be part of an organization that fought against an entity called The Pure One. In this organization, they were part of a squad of 4 other people. To make a long story short, the organization decided that the squad was infected by The Pure One and took them all out. Iris was supposed to die, but the entity they were sworn to fight against offered them a chance to continue living. Iris took the chance out of pure anger, but lived to regret it every day of their life. </p>
        <p>Now, their defining characteristic is the fact that they have little to no morals. This is mostly due to their patron, but they do make active decisions to kill anyone in their way. Later on in the campaign, they will be the direct cause of their best friend’s death. Iris has to apologize, but does not know how. The only apology they know to offer is their own life, as they have lived under the ideal of “an eye for an eye” for a long time. However, their friend doesn’t subscribe to that belief at all. She wants Iris to live, something Iris has not wanted in years. Iris’s one true regret is wanting to live.</p>
