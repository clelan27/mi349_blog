            <h2>Iris Vedroth</h2>
            <p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about a few of my Dungeons & Dragons characters; specifically, Iris Vedroth. Iris is an oathbreaker paladin multiclassed with the great old one warlock class, and they are particularly messed up. </p>
            <p>They used to be part of an organization that fought against an entity called The Pure One. In this organization, they were part of a squad of 4 other people. To make a long story short, the organization decided that the squad was infected by The Pure One and took them all out. Iris was supposed to die, but the entity they were sworn to fight against offered them a chance to continue living. Iris took the chance out of pure anger, but lived to regret it every day of their life. </p>
            <p>Now, their defining characteristic is the fact that they have little to no morals. This is mostly due to their patron, but they do make active decisions to kill anyone in their way. Later on in the campaign, they will be the direct cause of their best friend’s death. Iris has to apologize, but does not know how. The only apology they know to offer is their own life, as they have lived under the ideal of “an eye for an eye” for a long time. However, their friend doesn’t subscribe to that belief at all. She wants Iris to live, something Iris has not wanted in years. Iris’s one true regret is wanting to live.</p>

            <h2>Kardin Kemp</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I have been working on a universe for some of my own characters. I’ve dubbed this verse “Graders & Upgrades” due to the fact that those are the main ideas of the world. </p>
            <p>Upgrades are barely noticeable “superpowers” that give people increases to their natural abilities. For example, one of the upgrades of this world is called “Bullseye”. This ability allows the grader–the person with said upgrade–to be able to hit whatever target they desire with projectiles. Kardin Kemp is the person with this upgrade.</p>
            <p>Kardin is an abrasive and smart woman who has lived her entire life pushing people away. This is mainly due to her status as a grader, as graders are not welcome in society. Early in the story, she becomes a vigilante under the name “Deadshot”, following the footsteps of another vigilante, “Grace”. This decision is what jumpstarts her character arc. Over the course of the story, she becomes someone who, while still brash, does genuinely care for her friends and would do anything to ensure their safety. Through trials and tribulations, she learns that the world does not have to be “every man for himself”. She holds grudges to the grave, but loves those around her fiercely. </p>
