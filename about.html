    <h1>About Me</h1>

        <article>
            <p>My name is Kris Cleland and I am a fourth year student attending Michigan State University! I am originally from Los Angeles, but when I moved to Michigan for school I completely fell in love with the area. My major is Games & Interactive Media with a focus in art and animation! I have been doing art seriously for 8 years now and still have a ways to go, but it has been a pleasure learning different techniques and styles! While I mainly focus in 2D art, I do dabble in 3D art.</p>
            <p>My current interests include:</p>
            <li>Dungeons & Dragons</li>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>Books</li>
